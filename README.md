# Phase_3_project

This project aims to do in-depth data analysis and predictive modeling on a dataset with thousands of vehicle, their specifications, and their CO2 emissions. Specifications including engine size, cylinders, vehicle size, fuel type, etc. The primary objectives of this project are to identify impactful features, correlations, and identify statistically significant relationships. 

The analysis includes both descriptive and inferential statistics to assess key factors affecting vehicle CO2 emissions. The findings are based on a variety of visualizations and hypothesis tests, allowing us to draw meaningful conclusions about the dataset.

A predictive machine learning model is also included in this project. The model aims to intake the important features identified in the descriptive and inferential analyses, then effectively predicting its CO2 emissions with an acceptable level of accuracy.
